Simple jQuery plugin to unserialize data back into DOM forms.

Usage:

	var s = $("form").serialize(); // save form settings.
	$("form").unserializeForm(s);  // restore form settings

The serialized form data could be saved in a session, perhaps in HTML5 sessionstorage.
Note that saving the serialized data to a cookie is troublesome as not all browsers
implement the same cookie string lengths, so sessionstorage or a SQL db is recommended.
