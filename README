Simple jQuery plugin to unserialize data back into forms.

Usage:

	var s = $("form").serialize(); // save form settings.
	$("form").unserializeForm(s);  // restore form settings

The serialized form data could be saved in a session, perhaps in HTML5 sessionStorage.
Note that saving the serialized data to a cookie is troublesome as not all browsers
implement the same cookie string lengths, so sessionStorage or a SQL db is recommended.

Optionally, a second parameter may be passed to unserializeForm to provide a callback:

	var cb = function(element, value) { return true; // or false }

The callback will be given the name of the element to create and the value to set it to.
If the callback returns true, unserializeForm moves onto the next element, assuming the
callback handled the unserializing process, but if the callback returns false, it will
attempt to find and set the value of the element.

The purpose of this callback is to allow for the creation of dynamic forms. Again, it is
optional and may be ignored.

Known issues:

  * None.
